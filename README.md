capistrano-site5
===============

This is a simple plugin to deploy on a site5 account.

Installation
------------

Rails 2.x

	./script/plugin install git@github.com:dquimper/capistrano-site5.git

Rails 3.x

Add this to your Gemfile.

	gem 'capistrano-site5', :git => "git@github.com:dquimper/capistrano-site5.git"


Usage
-----

1. Create a sub-domain for the rails application that you wish to deploy.
2. Site5 interface will create a sub-directory in your public_html directory.
3. Create or modify your config/deploy.rb, the minimum require is:

		set :application, "myapp"

	The first part of your sub-domain. ex: For myapp.example.com, you only write myapp.

		set :repository,  "your git or github url"
		set :scm, :git
		set :deploy_via, :remote_cache
		set :git_shallow_clone, 1

	If your server has direct access to the repository

		set :deploy_via, :copy

	If you server does NOT have direct access to the repository (default)

		set :git_enable_submodules, 1

	If you have submodules in your project.

		set :user, "your username on the site5 server."
		server "example.com", :app, :web, :db, :primary => true
		
4. If you don't want to use `/home/#{user}/rails/#{application}` for your application location, you may redefine `deploy_to`

		set :deploy_to, "/home/#{user}/#{application}.example.com/#{application}"
		
5. Also, my default, Site5 links your sub-domain to `/home/#{user}/public_html/#{application}`. If you wish to modify this behavior:

		set :public_html, "/home/#{user}/#{application}.dansrc.com/public_html"
		
6. `$ cap deploy:setup`

    Capistrano will create it's regular deployment structure in your `deploy_to` directory.
    Then it will delete the directory site5 created when you created your domain and replace it with a symlink to your current public directory.
    
7. `$ cap deploy:check`

    Capistrano will check it's deployement structure (including your symlink to your current public directory.
    
8. `$ cap deploy`

    Capistrano will deploy your application and restart passenger.

Example
-------

**deploy.rb**

---
    set :application, "myapp"
    set :repository,  "git@github.com:someone/someproject.git"
    set :scm, :git
    set :deploy_via, :remote_cache
    set :git_shallow_clone, 1
    set :git_enable_submodules, 1
    set :user, "username"
    
    server "example.com", :app, :web, :db, :primary => true
    
    # If you aren't deploying to /home/#{user}/rails/#{application} on the target
    # servers (which is the default with this capistrano-site5 plugin), you can
    # specify the actual location via the :deploy_to variable:
    #set :deploy_to, "/home/#{user}/#{application}.dansrc.com/#{application}"
    #set :public_html, "/home/#{user}/#{application}.dansrc.com/public_html"
